        <h1><strong>The Story of the Last Slave</strong></h1>
        <h2><span style="font-size:16px;">by Chris Mack</span> </h2>
        <p>July 2, 2018</p>
          <p>I&#8217;ve just finished reading an absolutely amazing 
		  book that is currently on the New York Times bestseller list:
		   <em>Barracoon: The Story of the Last Slave</em>, by Zora Neale Hurston.</p>
		  <p>Zora Neale Hurston? Is she still writing? No. Zora Neale 
		  Hurston died in 1960 at the age of 69 (she was penniless and buried in 
		  an unmarked grave &#8211; but that is a different story). The book is based on interviews that Hurston conducted in 
		  1927-1928 and was finished in 1931. The story of the book&#8217;s making is not as interesting as the 
		  book itself, but is worth telling.</p>
		  <p>Hurston was a late bloomer, academically. Born in 1891 in Eatonville, Florida, she didn&#8217;t finish school 
		  during her childhood, graduating high school at the age of 27. She started college at Howard University at age 28. Possibly embarrassed by this late start she regularly told 
		  people she was born in 1901. After transferring to Barnard College in Manhattan and studying 
		  anthropology, she made collecting black folk tales and other stories a 
		  part of her life&#8217;s work. With support from the college and a wealthy patron, she was able to 
		  make several trips to the south for this purpose in 1927 and 1928. Much of that field work came to fruition in her first 
		  nonfiction book, <em>Mules and Men</em>, 
		  published in 1935. During 
		  these trips she also spent two months interviewing Oluale Kossola, 
		  known also by his slaveholder-assigned name Cudjo Lewis.</p>
		  <p>Kossola was a part of the human cargo of the last 
		  slaver to bring kidnapped Africans to the US, an illegal trade that 
		  was still too common in 1859/1860 when Kossola was enslaved. By 1927 he was the last remaining freed slave in America who 
		  was born in Africa. Unlike most other stories told by ex-slaves, Kossola&#8217;s started with 
		  the African side of the slave trade, including a brutal war and 
		  kidnapping by a neighboring tribe whose greed was fueled by 
		  slave-trade profits.</p>
		  <p>Kossola&#8217;s story, told in his own words and 
		  supplemented by Hurston&#8217;s historical research, is exceptionally 
		  compelling. As with <em>Mules and Men</em>, Hurston 
		  insisted on transcribing the words of her interview subjects 
		  phonetically to give authenticity to their stories. Many publishers assumed this language would turn off white 
		  readers and Hurston was unable to find a publisher for
		  <em>Barracoon</em>. While the manuscript has been available for scholarly research 
		  at Howard University, it was not published until 2018.</p>
		  <p>Hurston was the first black graduate of Barnard 
		  College, in 1928. Her 
		  second novel, <em>Their Eyes Were Watching God</em>, is a masterpiece written in just seven weeks while 
		  doing field work in Haiti in 1937. The influence of her anthropological work on
		  <em>Their Eyes Were Watching God</em> 
		  is obvious, and part of the reason why Hurston is known today as a 
		  &#8220;Genius of the South&#8221;.</p>
