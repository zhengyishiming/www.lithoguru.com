            <h1><strong>Semicon West Lithography Report</strong></h1>
            <h2><em>2012 Semicon West </em><br />
                <span style="font-size:16px;">by Chris Mack </span>
          </h2>
            <p> San Francisco, CA, July, 2012</p>
            <p>(The following  appeared first as a  blog at <a href="http://life.lithoguru.com/">http://life.lithoguru.com/</a> and is reproduced here.) </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>OK, I have to admit this right off: I didn&rsquo;t go to Semicon West (held two weeks ago in San Francisco). I try never to go to Semicon West (I&rsquo;ve been twice in the last 30 years, both times against my will). Why should I go? To listen to the latest marketing messages and company spin? To see a few technical talks that are way too light on the technical, but still full of talk? I don&rsquo;t need to walk the cavernous Moscone Center to get that &ndash; everybody plasters the Web with this stuff on a regular basis. Thanks, but I think I&rsquo;ll stay home. </p>
            <p>This year was a perfect case in point. The only real news from Semicon was in the news &ndash; Intel&rsquo;s announced investment in ASML. Yes, it would have been fun to sit in a San Francisco bar each evening and dissect the press releases and develop conspiracy theories. But even that is not really necessary. I&rsquo;m here to give my take on what the Intel investment means &ndash; and you don&rsquo;t even have to buy me a beer to get it. (Though if you like this post, please feel free to buy me one the next time you see me.) </p>
            <p>Intel&rsquo;s investment in ASML has two parts &ndash; related, but separate. First, Intel is spending $2.1B to buy 10% of ASML, with an option to buy another 5%. ASML will use the money to buy back the same number of its shares, so there will be no stock dilution (a so-called synthetic buyback). That also means ASML will be getting nothing (no money, I mean) from this part of the deal. ASML is also offering similar deals to Samsung and TSMC, up to 25% ownership in the company. So what does this part of the deal mean? Intel and ASML made it clear that Intel gets no voting rights and won&rsquo;t get early access to ASML technology or tools. Of course, they had to say that to avoid anti-trust litigation. So does the Intel investment help anyone? </p>
            <p>There are three reasons why the Intel investment in ASML makes sense. First, it confirms the obvious: the success or failure of ASML will be mirrored as success or failure at Intel. Lest anyone doubt it, Intel needs Moore&rsquo;s Law scaling to continue its growth and profitability. Lithography is the critical technology to make that happen, and ASML is the critical company to make lithography happen. Second, even without a place on the board, Intel&rsquo;s ownership stake will add financial stability to ASML, whose stock price could easily drop dramatically if its EUV program were to flirt with failure. Since ASML&rsquo;s importance to the industry goes far beyond its EUV program, keeping ASML developing and manufacturing lithography tools is critical. </p>
            <p>But the third reason the investment makes sense is that the stock purchase is coupled with a $1B Intel investment in ASML R&amp;D. This $1B infusion is what the whole deal is about, and the investment has one purpose: to speed 450-mm tool development at ASML. For several years now, as talk of 450-mm wafer sizes has heated up to what appears to be a critical mass, ASML has repeatedly said that it can&rsquo;t do EUV and 450-mm development at the same time. After EUV has succeeded, then ASML will commit to 450-mm tool development. But since the day of reckoning for EUV continues to push out (possibly to 2016 or later), that means lithography, representing 50% of the cost of making a chip, won&rsquo;t be 450-mm ready nearly in time to meet the (overly optimistic) timetables of the big 450-mm proponents (Intel, Samsung, and TSMC). </p>
            <p>So here comes the investment from Intel. While the press release mentioned the importance of both EUV and 450-mm R&amp;D, the only project mentioned for funding was 450-mm tool development. And to be clear, this is not only, or even mostly, EUV 450-mm development. A working 450-mm fab will need 193-immersion tools, 193 dry tools, and maybe 248-nm tools as well, all running at the 450-mm wafer size. If EUV works, a fab will need 450-mm EUV tools as well, but this is the only part of the lithography tool set that is optional for a 450-mm fab. So, in my opinion, the Intel investment is all about the 450-mm wafer size, and has essential nothing to do with EUV lithography. </p>
            <p>Why is 450-mm development so important to Intel (and Samsung and TSMC)? My answer to that question next time. </p>
