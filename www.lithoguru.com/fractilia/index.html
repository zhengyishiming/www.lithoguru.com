            <h2>&nbsp;</h2>
            <h2 class="style1">February 21, 2017</h2>
            <p> Today I am proud to announce my new company, Fractilia, LLC. </p>
            <p> Seventeen years ago I sold my lithography simulation company FINLE Technologies, and five years later I settled into the life of the &ldquo;Gentleman Scientist&rdquo;. My goal was to contribute to the science and practice of lithography through my research, teaching, and writing, all the while looking into the problems that I thought were the most interesting. For the last 10 years I have been studying an entirely fascinating topic: stochastic-induced roughness. It is an incredibly interesting, fun, and important topic, and I have written 25 papers since 2009 that I hope have contributed something to our community&rsquo;s understanding of this vexing problem. My goal has been to help transform our understanding of stochastics and roughness, so that we can better tackle the problem of reducing it. </p>
            <p> Recently, though, I&rsquo;ve come to realize that right now the best way for me to realize my vision of making a positive impact on the industry&rsquo;s efforts on stochastic-induced roughness is to commercialize my ideas in software. So I&rsquo;ve recently teamed up with my old partner from the FINLE days, Ed Charrier, to start a new company and to introduce a new product. </p>
            <p> The goal of Fractilia is to bring rigor, accuracy, and ease-of-use to the analysis of stochastic-induced roughness in semiconductor manufacturing and process development. Fractilia develops and delivers software solutions that provide customers with something I think is currently lacking in the industry: accurate and repeatable analysis of SEM images to extract the true roughness behavior of the wafer features. We have combined decades of lithography experience with our unique image analysis models and algorithms to create MetroLER, an intuitive and accurate product for analyzing pattern roughness, including LER and LWR. </p>

            <p> Thank you, and wish us luck. </p>
